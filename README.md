Worlds First Userspace Language

_Code Like I'm 5_

The goal of emoji Code is such that the user would be able to determine what the code did and was for without having any prior technical or coding knowledge. Therefore the user could theoretically change the code to hit their needs.

EmojiCode sits in the space between the WYSIWYG editors of old, and modern markup languages.
Woth he tevent of emoji, hoeroglyphic-like pictographs can commute complex knowledge in he tspace of a character, this solves two problems coming to languages:
 * The Standards Problem: What is an image? Is it  ajpg, a long, a gif? Emoji code solves this by being so high level, it doesn't care. It assumes the user doesnt care either, so in a since it is a DSL (domain specific language) for the user. So this is an image ðŸ“Š and this is a video: ðŸ“º and this is a document: ðŸ“„ and the VM will figure it out
 * The Keyword prpblem: is it for each, for, for in, for as, or what? Every languages uses multiple particles or spellings. Emoji code doesn't. Each emoji is the one nd aonly standard. You cannot misspell an emoji! Also emojis are international.
